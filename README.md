Interactive Housing Market Data Analysis Notebook
Overview

This project is an interactive data analysis notebook that demonstrates relationships between housing prices, property size, age, and location using a synthetic housing dataset. Users can dynamically explore the dataset through interactive sliders and dropdowns while visualizations and statistics update in real time.

The notebook leverages Marimo, a reactive notebook framework, to create a smooth, interactive experience suitable for data exploration, teaching, and demonstrations.
